      <description>My name is Simon Sure, I&amp;rsquo;m 19 years old and currently located in Zurich, Switzerland. I am originally from Kempen, Germany and moved for my Computer Science Bachelor studies to Switzerland. I enjoy working intensively on projects but still focus mostly on my studies @ETHZurich. Besides, I join events from institutions and companies whenever possible. To balance all those activities, I go running regularly and currently train for marathons.
Since the semester which started in September 2023, I am teaching assistant for Discrete Mathematics @ETHZurich.</description>
