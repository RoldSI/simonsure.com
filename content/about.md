Welcome to my digital space! I'm Simon Sure, a tech enthusiast with a relentless drive for innovation, learning, and making a tangible impact. Immersed in the world of Computer Science at ETH Zurich, I'm not just a student; I'm a fervent explorer at the intersection of technology and real-world challenges. With an unyielding work ethic and drive, I'm always seeking new experiences and challenges to help me grow, both personally and professionally.

My path is marked by exciting projects, top internships, and meaningful personal initiatives. I've tackled real-world problems in robotics, AI-powered education, and environmental monitoring. Curious? [Check out some of my projects.](/contact) Right now, I am adding software experience at cutting-edge giants like NVIDIA and Optiver to my ever-growing skillset.
