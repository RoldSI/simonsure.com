This showcases some of the projects I have worked on in recent years. If you have any questions or want to learn more, please [reach out](/contact).

While studying I provide my notes and preparation scripts online. You can find those [here](/ethz).

Also, I participate in and am always on the lookout for Hackathons (and other events). If you can recommand any hackathon or event (globally), please [let me know](/contact).
