🚀 Exciting times ahead! In the coming weeks, I'll be diving into a series of hackathons across Europe, and I'm thrilled to share the journey with you all. Each event presents a unique opportunity to learn, innovate, and connect with incredible people in the tech community.

🌍 First stop: ETHTallinn in Tallinn, Estonia (April 19-21). This marks my first ETH event experience. ETHTallinn is poised to be the most important event in the Baltics, uniting Ethereum enthusiasts to innovate on DeFi, NFT, and Web3 technologies. It’s a perfect platform for networking and collaborative learning in one of Europe's most digitally advanced cities.

🔍 Then I'm headed to the ZEISS Group Computer Vision Hackathon: Reveal the Invisible in Karlsruhe, Germany (April 26-28). This event focuses on harnessing computer vision for real-world applications, offering access to state-of-the-art equipment such as AI-powered cameras and 3D scanners. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to develop software that could revolutionize how we interact with digital and real environments.

🇮🇹 Finally, the EUDIS Hackathon in Milan, Italy (May 31 - June 2) emphasizes real-time data solutions and invites a diverse mix of backgrounds to contribute. The theme provides a unique twist by focusing less on traditional defense and more on innovative digital applications in new contexts.

I'm looking forward to every opportunity to learn from industry experts, tackle challenging projects, and meet inspiring people. If you're also attending these or other exciting hackathons, please reach out—I'd love to connect! Additionally, if you have suggestions for other great events, let me know in the comments.
